# Automate Power Mode for Atom

I like [Activate Power Mode](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode) but not all the time, and I definitely don't stop and think to enable it when things _start getting real_.

**When your typing speed increases, power mode will automatically be enabled.** This package depends on [Activate Power Mode](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode) and does nothing without it.

## TODOs

- ~~Activate when typing speed passes a threshold~~ ✓
- ~~Deactivate when typing speed drops below a threshold~~ ✓
- Turn up power mode intensity slowly on a curve as typing speed increases
- User customizable intensity curve in setting
